# Brief Introduction About Myself

My name is NUBAHA Justin. I am a student and a refugee residing in Rwanda. I'm passionate about learning technology and applying digital tools to make a difference in my community. I’m currently learning Git and GitHub to improve my skills in version control and collaboration.

Outside of tech, I’m also involved in farming and community service. I enjoy reading, praying, and helping others, especially those who are vulnerable or facing challenges in life.
