My Personal and Academic Goals for Next Year

1. Improve Digital Design Skills
   I will complete at least one online tutorial or project each month to enhance my portfolio and confidence in design tools.

2. Secure a University Scholarship  
   I will apply to multiple scholarship programs that support refugee students to fund my undergraduate studies in psychology or a related science field.

3. Grow My Pig Farming Business  
   I plan to expand the "Short Farming Refugees" initiative by increasing the number of pigs and involving more refugee families in the training.

4. Build a Climate Change Awareness Website  
   I aim to design and launch a basic educational website to teach youth about climate change and encourage environmental action.

5. Strengthen My Leadership Abilities  
   I will take on additional leadership roles in volunteer activities, especially at "Help Adults and People Without Capability," and help guide others through counseling and mentorship.
